# Employee-Tracker

## Description
  
This project is to be used as a easy way to get used to SQL commands, and using user input to navigate and change databases using the MYSQL2 package. It was better to get a understanding of how to use "Keys" and joining tables as well as get more practice with inquirer I learned that If you are dealing with databases, it's best to get in the habit or using fuctions such as map() and filter().
